Deluge is one of the most user friendly torrent clients we offer. It has a simple to understand and navigate interface and offers thin clients on all major operating systems.

Deluge is a powerful client and is popular for racing, it is an aggressive seeding client and is favored for that reason.

The one major downside of Deluge is that it has trouble handling a large amount of torrents, it usually starts to struggle at ~700 loaded files.

The combination of ruTorrent and rTorrent is also an incredibly user friendly experience. For those who may be used to using uTorrent the interface is extremely similar.

rTorrent alone is a CLI (Command Line Interface) program. On it's own it can handle thousands upon thousands of torrents, however it can be difficult to use. To ease in the usage we can install the web based GUI ruTorrent. ruTorrent improves usability, however it also decreases rTorrent's potential - despite this it can still easily handle multiple thousands of torrents!

rTorrent is a good option for decent seeding performance combined with high torrent count, it is good at both of these however a master of neither.

# Transmission

## No frills mass torrenting

Transmission is one of the least user friendly clients we offer. It has a very minimal interface with very few accessible options. While on one hand it is plain it is also very stable.

Transmission does not have great seeding performance, but this is offset by the large amount of torrents it can handle. If you want a client that will handle many torrents long term seeding then this is for you.
